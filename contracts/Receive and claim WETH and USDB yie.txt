Receive and claim WETH and USDB yield
Similar to ETH, WETH and USDB on Blast is also rebasing and follows the same yield mode configurations.

However, unlike ETH where contracts have Disabled yield by default, WETH and USDB accounts have Automatic yield by default for both EOAs and smart contracts.

Users can change the yield mode of their WETH and USDB accounts by calling the configure function on the relevant token address.


enum YieldMode {
    AUTOMATIC,
    VOID,
    CLAIMABLE
}

interface IWETHUSDBRebasing {
    // changes the yield mode of the caller and update the balance
    // to reflect the configuration
    configure(YieldMode) external returns (uint256);
}

contract MyContract {
		constructor(address gov) {
              IWETHUSDBRebasing(0x42...22).configure(YieldMode.CLAIMABLE) //configure claimable yield for USDB
			  IWETHUSDBRebasing(0x42...23).configure(YieldMode.CLAIMABLE) //configure claimable yield for WETH
		}
}
The WETH and USDB addresses will be slightly different on the Blast mainnet.

USDB is deployed, but not currently live on the Blast Sepolia testnet. USDB is expected to go live on the testnet around January 22.
